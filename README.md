# electron-boiler
Opinionated electron.atom.io boilerplate / template that incorporates _less_, _react_ (w/ es2015/react plugins of _babel_). Using _gulp_ as the main task runner.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [**node and npm**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine. It's also handy to have [**gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/) installed globally (use `npm install gulp -g` to install) as the build process relies on this.

### Ok, I have those prerequisites, now what?

1. Open a terminal or console and execute the following command to clone the boilerplate and create a new repo with your own project name.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aredfox/electron-boiler my-electron-project
   ```

2. Then navigate via your terminal or console to the project folder and execute the following command to install the needed npm modules.

   ```
   npm install
   ```
    
3. To run the application (in "dev" mode) use the following command.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    _TIP: run command "`npm install && npm start`" to combine steps 2 and 3._
